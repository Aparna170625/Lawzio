Prompt to Check Project Functionality:
1. Legal Document Analysis:
Goal: Does the system automatically analyze complex legal documents across multiple Indian languages (Hindi, Tamil, English, Marathi)?

Check:

Is there an OCR integration (using Tesseract) to read scanned documents?

Does the system detect the language of the document using langdetect and translate it using IndicTrans?

2. Key Clause Extraction:
Goal: Extract key clauses from legal documents.

Check:

Does the model use XLM-RoBERTa or other models for Clause Classification to identify and extract the most important legal clauses?

3. Legal Risk Detection:
Goal: Automatically detect legal risks (low, medium, high) within documents.

Check:

Is there a hybrid model combining Rule-based logic, SVM, and Legal-BERT for identifying risks in legal text?

Does it detect risk based on certain legal clauses or terms?

4. Summarization of Content:
Goal: Summarize legal documents in simple, multilingual output.

Check:

Does the system generate concise summaries using mT5-small?

Are summaries available in multiple languages and tailored for non-expert users?

5. Explainable AI (XAI) Integration:
Goal: Ensure transparency in decision-making.

Check:

Does the system use SHAP values and attention maps for explainability?

Can users view the reasoning behind legal risk detection or clause extraction?

6. Active Learning:
Goal: Improve the system using real-time feedback.

Check:

Is there a feedback loop for users (e.g., lawyers or clients) to provide corrections that improve the model over time?

7. Contrastive Learning for Similar Clauses:
Goal: Help the model distinguish between similar legal clauses.

Check:

Does the system use contrastive learning to help identify nuances and small differences between clauses?

8. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):
Goal: Identify relationships between legal clauses.

Check:

Does the system use GNNs to map connections between different parts of a legal document (e.g., clauses and their dependencies)?

9. Evaluation Metrics:
Goal: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

Check:

Are the system's outputs evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, ROUGE, BLEU, and human feedback?

10. Deployment:
Goal: Ensure a robust and secure deployment for end-users.

Check:

Is the system deployed using FastAPI with AES-256 encryption for secure communication?

Does it support Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?

Is the system Dockerized for easy deployment on AWS or GCP?

Is the frontend using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface?

11. Security and Data Privacy:
Goal: Ensure data privacy and secure access.

Check:

Is AES-256 encryption implemented for sensitive legal data?

Does the system use JWT tokens for secure authentication and authorization?

12. Scalability:
Goal: The system should scale with increasing data and users.

Check:

Can the system scale to handle more languages beyond Hindi, Tamil, English, and Marathi?

Is the backend optimized to handle large document uploads and analyses?
